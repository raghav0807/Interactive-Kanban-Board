## **‚ú® Key Features**

### **Dynamic Grouping**

Effortlessly group tasks with just a click:

- **By Status**: Tasks are categorized into stages like Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, and Canceled.
- **By User**: Tasks are displayed according to their assigned user, with live availability indicators.
- **By Priority**: Organize tasks from No Priority to Urgent.

### **Custom Sorting**

Refine task views for better prioritization:

- **Sort by Priority**: Tasks are ranked in descending priority order.
- **Sort by Title**: Tasks are arranged alphabetically for quick lookup.

### **User Preferences Persistence**

Your selected view is saved automatically, ensuring a consistent experience every time you return to the application.

### **Fully Responsive Design**

From desktop to mobile, the application maintains its functionality and aesthetics with horizontal scrolling and adaptive layouts.

### **Interactive Visuals**

- **Priority Badges**: Quickly identify task importance with distinct labels.
- **User Availability Indicators**: Green dots signify available users, while red dots indicate unavailability.

## Screenshots

### 1. Grouping by Status and Sorting by Priority (Default View)

This screenshot shows the default state of the Kanban board when the page is loaded or reloaded. By default, the tickets are grouped by **Status**, and they are sorted by **Priority** in descending order. The status groups include options like **Backlog**, **ToDo**, **In Progress**, **Done**, and **Canceled**.

### 2. Grouping by User and Sorting by Priority

In this view, the tickets are grouped by the **Assigned User**, which means each user will have their own column displaying the tasks assigned to them. The tickets within each user column are then sorted by **Priority** in descending order.

### 3. Grouping by Priority and Sorting by Priority

This screenshot shows the Kanban board when the grouping option is set to **Priority**. The tickets are grouped based on their priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low, No Priority). Within each group, the tickets are also sorted by **Priority**, so the highest priority tasks (Urgent) will appear first.
